Method 1: Running Using ChatLauncher (Recommended)

This is the simplest and cleanest way because the launcher handles starting the server or client.

Step 1: Compile the project

Open a terminal inside your project folder (where .java files exist):

javac ChatServer.java ChatClient.java ChatLauncher.java

Step 2: Run the launcher
java ChatLauncher

What Happens Next

The launcher will show options such as:

Start Server

Start Client

You simply:

Select Start Server in one terminal

Select Start Client in another terminal (you can open multiple clients)

Advantages

Clean and organized

No need to manually remember which class to run

Easy for users/testers

Single entry point for the entire project

✅ Method 2: Running Each File Manually (Without Launcher)

This is helpful for debugging or if you want to run server and clients independently.

Step 1: Run the Server

Open Terminal 1:

Compile
javac ChatServer.java

Run
java ChatServer


Server will start and wait for connections.

Step 2: Run the Client

Open Terminal 2:

Compile
javac ChatClient.java

Run
java ChatClient


If your GUI requires an IP and port, enter:

Server IP: localhost

Port: 5000 (or whatever your server uses)

You can open multiple clients by running the same command in more terminals.

🧪 Optional: Visual Studio Code Method
Running Server

Open ChatServer.java

Click Run (top-right of VS Code Editor)

Or press Ctrl + F5

Running Client

Right-click the file → Open in Integrated Terminal

Then run:

javac ChatClient.java
java ChatClient


Open multiple terminals for multiple clients:

VS Code top menu → Terminal → New Terminal
